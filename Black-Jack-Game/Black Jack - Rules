Black Jack - Rules

We will implement a simplified version of Black Jack:

    The player starts with no cards (score of 0)
    The bank starts with a score between 16 and 21
    For each round, the player can:
        Draw a card with a random value between 1 and 11. This number will be added to his/her score.
        Draw another, or stick with the current score and finish the game.
    In the end, there are 5 possibilities:
        If the player’s score is > 21, they "Lose" (bust).
        If the player’s score is 21, they pull a "Black Jack" and win.
        If the player’s score is > than the bank’s, they "Win".
        If the player’s score is < than the bank’s, they "Lose".
        If the player’s score is == to the bank’s, it’s a "Push". The player gets their money back.
